# pursuit changelog

Please see https://github.com/purescript/pursuit/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md for
the most up-to-date version of this file.

## v0.6.3

* Add a "load more" button for display of additional search results
  (@felixschl, #305)
* Fix source links in re-exported declarations (@felixschl, #345)
* Display the types of data constructors and type class members in search
  results (@hdgarrood, #264)
* Include entries from `Prim` in search results (@hdgarrood, #265)
* Allow data constructors and type class members to be found when searching by
  type (@hdgarrood, #303)
* Fix searching for type operators by name (@hdgarrood, #330)
* Slightly promote search results which come from packages with more reverse
  dependencies (@hdgarrood, #353)
* Fix an issue where any query which included a hyphen would be treated as a
  type, preventing searching by name; this was a problem for queries such as
  e.g. "generics-rep".
* Take into account whether type variables match when performing type search.
  For example, after this change, `map` ranks higher than `cmap` for the query
  "(a -> b) -> f a -> f b"; previously they were equally ranked.
* Add help explaining the search feature (@hdgarrood / @grossbart, #339, #357)

* Clarify contributing docs (@grossbart)
