Relinking with modified versions of LGPL v2.1 libraries

Pursuit depends on some Haskell libraries which are LGPL v2.1 licensed. As per
the terms of that license, we explain here how to compile a version of Pursuit
using modified versions of these libraries.

* Obtain the Pursuit source code: https://github.com/purescript/pursuit
* Obtain the source code for the LGPL component, which is available from
  Hackage, and make your desired modifications
* Create a cabal sandbox
* Use `cabal sandbox add-source` to use your modified version of the LGPL
  component rather than the Hackage version.

their licenses are listed below:
